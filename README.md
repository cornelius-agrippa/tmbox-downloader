# tmbox-downloader

#### What is it

A tmbox web-crawler/downloader that allows you to bulk download every song published by a user on tmbox.net.

#### Requirements

- Python 3
- Beautiful Soup 4

#### Usage

To download a user's song list simply run the `Execute.py` script, providing the URL for the page as an argument:

`python Execute.py https://tmbox.net/user/<username>`

#### Issues, Suggestions or New Features

Please open an issue on this project's page. I'm always interested to know where to improve or what new features could be added. 

The script is currently very minimal because I only wrote it for myself, but if you need extra features, by all means ask away.
